A simple app to upload an image to OpenAI Vision for analysis. If the item is food we will gather the pros, cons, type & overall summary about the food.

## Installation
To install and run HealthApp:
1. Download and open the project
2. Add your OpenAI API Key in the `MealController` file:

```swift
// MealController
private let openAIClient = OpenAI.Client(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY")
```
*You can get the OpenAI API key on the [OpenAI developer website](https://platform.openai.com/). Note that you have to set up billing and add a small amount of money for the API calls to work (this will cost you less than 1 dollar).* 

3. Run the project on your iPhone. Note that you'll need to use the Camera, so run on device.
4. Take a picture of your food to get the health details:
